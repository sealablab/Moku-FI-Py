# TODO
Actually write/check-in the moku python code
dont forget to check out the python [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com) module.
It looks like a good start.

Also dont forget to setup a `uv` environment to kick this off
maybe check out that [self contained python scripts with uv](https://blog.dusktreader.dev/2025/03/29/self-contained-python-scripts-with-uv/) post as well.
